# Speleologger
The Speleologger is an Open Source system for monitoring karst waters, with a custom board based on the Atmel AVR ATmega32U4. The goal of this project is to produce a small, low power device that can accept a variety of water chemistry sensors and probes. The design and code is influenced by Ed Mallon's (https://github.com/EKMallon) Cave Pearl Project, with modifications for ease-of-use, and code and hardware compactness.
